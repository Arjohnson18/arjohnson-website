        Yo, I'm <strong>Acacia Johnson</strong>. I am a current graduate student pursuing a MS in Management with a Concentration in Business Analytics. I have
        a strong analytical mindset and effective management skills. I would love te oppurtunity to apply and expand expertise in finance,
        business analytics, and project management to make meaningful contributions in a dynamic corporate environment.
    </p>

        When I'm not coding or working on data projects, you can find me playing the piano or trombone, listening to jazz, or playing
        some video games. I’m obsessed with Formula 1 and MotoGP (any motorsport really) and anything that improves
        who I am as a person.
    </p>

        Some of my current projects involve building a self-hosted storage system for Pokémon save files, fiddling in Linux,
        and exploring digital minimalism. Always down to connect with like-minded people.
