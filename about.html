        Yo, I'm <strong>Acacia Johnson</strong>. I am a current graduate student pursuing a MS in Management with a Concentration in Business Analytics. I have
        a strong analytical mindset and effective management skills. I would love te oppurtunity to apply and expand expertise in finance,
        business analytics, and project management to make meaningful contributions in a dynamic corporate environment.

        When I'm not coding or working on data projects, you can find me playing the piano or trombone, listening to jazz, or playing
        some video games. I’m obsessed with Formula 1 and MotoGP (any motorsport really) and anything that improves
        who I am as a person.

        Some of my current projects involve building a self-hosted storage system for Pokémon save files, fiddling in Linux,
        and exploring digital minimalism. Always down to connect with like-minded people.
